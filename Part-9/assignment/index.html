            You get dignity, <br />When you stop thinking wrong <br />
            When you do what you learn right
        </p>
        <p>
            You can live dignified, <br />When you live a lifestyle that,
            <br />matches your vision
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get dignity <br />when you renounce the “ego of
            individuality”.
            <br />
            and rejoice ups and downs of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is dignity, <br />
            when you have good thoughts, <br />in your heart and mind.

        <h2>Summer</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Cause a little bit of summer is what the whole year is all about.</p>
        <p>
            Summer <br />The warmth on my skin, <br />The heat on my face,
            <br />Humidity in the air, <br />The sweat after a race.
            <br />Longer days with fun and joy,<br />
            Is what summer brings. <br />The sky in a brilliant shade of blue,
            <br />And so many more things. <br />The cold, tingling feeling of
            the pool, <br />As our skin gives a sigh of relief.<br />
            Our minds thinking of the lazy days,<br />
            When nobody is in grief. <br />The sun shines merrily above the
            horizon, <br />Sharing its heat and light. <br />A smile on
            everybody’s face, <br />As our hearts are filled with delight!

            Life of an Ant and a Spider <br />
            Behind the bush, upon the mound, <br />ants are moving without a
            sound.
            <br />
            Leaves are passed along the chain, <br />where ants are lined as one
        </p>
        <p>
            Strands of silver make its net, <br />a fly is caught in its web;
            <br />Now it’s too late, <br />the spider comes to seal its fate.
        </p>

        <p>
            They march on to feed the queen,<br />
            deep below she lays unseen. <br />Workers feed the silent drones,
            <br />in their capsule breeding zones.
